- 👋 Hi, I’m @DirkScheu
- 👀 I’m interested in AI
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to connect a turbidity sensor to an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense and to apply Edge Impulse for my vision to save billions of water wasted during backwash operation of water filters
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my vision with experts as I am a bloody beginner. But I always say: Auch ein "alter" Esel ist noch lernfähig! or in English: Even an old donkey still learns tricks!
- 📫 How to reach me try it via Google ;-)
